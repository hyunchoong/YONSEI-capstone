"GearPet" is a pet-breeding game.
You can manage your pet using your 'STEP'. Using accelerator sensor in Tizen wearable device(Samsung Gear S2), your step count is calculated. Unity is used to design the overall game, and Tizen plug-in is used to retrieve acceleration values.

Uploaded files are whole Unity Engine project named 'Scene Test'.
Tizen Plug-In used for calculating 'step count' with acceleration sensor is saved at 'Assets/Plugins/Tizen/'.
Since some assets(from Unity Asset Store) used in the project are limited by lincences, they are eliminated from the project.
You can develop your own 'Gear Pet' by using your own assets.

You can try ours by downloading 'GearPet.tpk'.
